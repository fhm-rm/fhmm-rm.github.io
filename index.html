          <p>This space exists because you matter to me. I needed a place to slow down and say what my heart means, not what my mouth failed to. And I never want to be careless with something so precious. I have hurt you in unimaginable ways. 
            I’m not writing this to explain myself. I’m writing because I want you to know that I see the weight my words carried, and I understand why they hurt you. I spoke without enough care, and the damage wasn’t in the intention—it was in the impact.
            For that, I am deeply sorry. You didn’t deserve sharpness. You didn’t deserve to feel small, questioned, or unsafe with me. I regret that I caused that. I don’t expect forgiveness, and I won’t rush you toward it.
            All I want you to know is that this effort is real,
            and I’m taking responsibility for becoming gentler, more mindful, and more deserving of your trust. (27 December 2025)

          <p>
            I haven’t met many people who are genuinely kind. You are—not because you try to be, but because that’s who you are.

            You’re warm. You’re nice. And you’re kind to me. That has meant more to me than you probably realize. Being around you feels so safe and peaceful.
            You feel better than home. The way you smile when you see me from a distance—those small moments stay with me.
            I chose you because of how you love and who you are as a person.
            You have a softness that’s rooted in you, and it comes out when you feel safe. That is unmatched.
            You have integrity, honesty and loyalty. You do the right thing even when it’s difficult. You know your worth.
            You're serious about your career and ambitions, and I admire that drive in you.
            You're funny, has a great sense of humor, and you can make me laugh even on my worst days.
            You are beautiful, inside and out. Your heart shines through in everything you do.
            You bring peace, You are peace.
